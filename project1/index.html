                <h2>Father of Pakistan's atomic weapons program</h2>
                <p><b>In January 2004, Khan was subjected</b> to a debriefing by the Musharraf administration over
                    evidence of
                    nuclear proliferation handed to them by the Bush administration of the United States.[6][7] Khan
                    admitted his role in running a nuclear proliferation network â€“ only to retract his statements in
                    later years when he leveled accusations at the former administration of Pakistan's Prime Minister
                    Benazir Bhutto in 1990, and also directed allegations at President Musharraf over the controversy in
                    2008.[8][9][10]

                    Khan was accused of selling nuclear secrets illegally and was put under house arrest in 2004. After
                    years of house arrest, Khan successfully filed a lawsuit against the Federal Government of Pakistan
                    at the Islamabad High Court whose verdict declared his debriefing unconstitutional and freed him on
                    6 February 2009.[11][12] The United States reacted negatively to the verdict and the Obama
                    administration issued an official statement warning that Khan still remained a "serious
                    proliferation risk".[13]

                    After his death on 10 October 2021, he was given a state funeral at Faisal Mosque before being
                    buried at the H-8 graveyard in Islamabad.</p>

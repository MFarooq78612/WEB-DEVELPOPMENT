            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <article>
                <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games,
                    in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic
                    styling; with animation, etc. Developed in Netscape, JS allows developers to create a dynamic and
                    interactive web page to interact with visitors and execute complex actions. It also enables users to
                    load content into a document without reloading the entire page.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive
                    (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).The core ecosystem of
                    JavaScript consists of 3 main components which are ECMAScript, JavaScript Engine, and the JavaScript
                    Runtime. It all starts with understanding what is ECMAScript and how is it different from JavaScript
                    and followed by an understanding of the JavaScript Engine and the JavaScript Runtime.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript as a scripting language for use with the company's
                        flagship web browser, Netscape Navigator. Initially known as LiveScript, Netscape changed the
                        name to JavaScript so they could position it as a companion for the Java language, a product of
                        their partner, Sun Microsystems.</li>
                    <li>JS stands for JavaScript. It is a text-based, lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted
                        scripting programming language. This language is very popular for developing web pages. It can
                        be used both on the client-side and server-side.</li>

                    <li>You can add properties to almost everything</li>
                    <li>Functions are objects</li>

                    <li>JavaScript never <span>sleep()s</span></li>
                    <li> Automatic type conversions</li>
                    <li> JavaScript is code – not data or markup</li>
                    <li> JavaScript is not just for browsers</li>

                <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a loosely typed language and has a more relaxed syntax and rules. Java is an
                    object-oriented programming language primarily used for developing complex enterprise applications.
                    JavaScript is a scripting language used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages.</p>
                <h4>What is JavaScript? </h4>
                <p>JavaScript is a lightweight programming language(“scripting language”) and is used to make web pages
                    interactive. It can insert dynamic text into HTML. JavaScript is also known as the browser’s
                    language.
                    JavaScript(JS) is not similar to or related to Java. Both languages have a C-like syntax and are
                    widely
                    used in client-side and server-side Web applications, but there are few similarities.</p>
                <h4>JavaScript</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation. Earlier websites were mostly
                        static,
                        after JS was created dynamic Web sites were made.</li>
                    <li>Functions in JS are objects. They may have properties and methods just like other objects. They
                        can
                        be passed as arguments in other functions.</li>
                    <li>Can handle date and time</li>
                    <li>Performs Form Validation although the forms are created using HTML.</li>
                    <li>No compiler is needed.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Java</h4>
                <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language and has a virtual machine platform that allows you to
                    create compiled programs that run on nearly every platform. Java promised, “Write Once, Run
                    Anywhere”<br>Features of Java are as follows: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Platform Independent:</h4>
                        <p><b>The compiler</b> converts source code to bytecode and then the JVM executes
                            the bytecode generated by the compiler. This bytecode can run on any platform.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Object-Oriented Programming Language: </h4>
                        <p> Organizing the program in terms of a collection of objects is a way of object-oriented
                            programming, each of which represents an instance of the class. There are 4 pillars of OOP’s
                            concept:</p>
                    <li><a href="#">Abstraction</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Encapsulation</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Inheritance</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Polymorphism</a></li>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Hello World</h2>
                A "Hello, World!" is a simple program that prints Hello, World! on the screen. Since it's a very simple
                program, this program is often used to introduce a new programming language to beginners.
                <p>We will use these three ways to print 'Hello, World!'.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>console.log()</li>
                    <li>alert()</li>
                    <li>document.write()</li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Using console.log()</h4>
                        <p>console.log() is used in debugging the code.</p>
                        <h4>Source Code</h4>
                        <code>// the hello world program <br>
                console.log('Hello World');</code>
                        <h4>Output</h4>
                        <p>Hello, World!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Using alert()</h4>
                        <p>The <code>alert() </code>method displays an alert box over the current window with the
                            specified message.</p>
                        <h4>Source Code</h4>
                        <code>
                            // the hello world program <br>
                            alert("Hello, World!");    
                        </code>
                        <h4>OutPut</h4>
                        <p>Hello, World!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Using document.write()</h2>
                        <p><code>document.write() </code>is used when you want to print the content to the HTML
                            document.</p>
                        <h4>Source Code</h4>
                        <code>
                            // the hello world program <br>
                              document.write('Hello, World!');
                        </code>
                        <h4>OutPut</h4>
                        <p>Hello, World!</p>
